                                                   EDA Bank Loan Data Project
Introduction

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of bank loan data. The objective is to analyze loan applications, identify trends, and uncover key insights that can help in better decision-making for loan approvals. The analysis includes key performance indicators (KPIs) like the total number of loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios, among others.

A dashboard has been created using Power BI to visualize the findings and provide an interactive experience for users.

Tools Used:

-SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and query-based analysis.

-Power BI: To create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

Tasks Performed:

1.) Good Loan vs Bad Loan Analysis:

Identification of loans classified as "Good" or "Bad" based on the repayment history and risk factors.

2.) Interest Rate Analysis:

Analysis of the interest rates offered on different loan types, segmented by various factors such as loan purpose and loan risk.

3.) Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):

Calculation of the average DTI for loan applicants and identifying trends across different loan categories.

4.)Total Funded Amount:

Analysis of the total amount of loans funded and distributed across various regions.

5.)Total Loan Applications:

Calculation of the total number of loan applications received, categorized by region and loan type.

6.) Total Received Amount:

Amount received from borrowers, helping in identifying the recovery rates and overall performance of the loan portfolio.

7.) US State-wise Loan Information:

A breakdown of loan applications, funded amounts, and other key metrics by U.S. states.

8.) Purpose of Loan:

Analysis of the various purposes for which loans were applied, such as home improvement, debt consolidation, education, etc.

9.)Additional Metrics:

Further insights on loan approval rates, funding delays, borrower demographics, and more.

Data Visualizations:

Interactive dashboards have been created to visualize the following:

-Good vs Bad Loan Distribution

-Interest Rate Distribution across Loan Types

-Funded and Received Amounts by U.S. States

-Loan Applications by Purpose

-Debt-to-Income Ratio Trends


You can explore the Power BI dashboard to interact with the data and draw deeper insights.
